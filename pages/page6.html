    <p class="scrap-text p6-text1">When you told me that you liked writing letters for people, I was abit skeptical cos I've never really hand-wrote letters to people before, ESPECIALLY my partner, So I didn't know if I would like it. But NOW, I love being able to write down my thoughts and show you my appreciaction for you on paper. We gotta do this more often!</p>
    <p class="scrap-text p6-text2">I feel like when I wrote this, I fully understood why a personalised gift is way better than anything you can buy with money. This letter is like the precursor as to why I made this website for you!</p>
